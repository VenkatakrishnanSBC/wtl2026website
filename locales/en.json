    "faq3A1": "Customs duties in Senegal are calculated based on several factors:",
    "faq3HSLabel": "HS Code Classification:",
    "faq3HSText": "Every product is assigned a Harmonized System (HS) tariff code that determines the applicable duty rate.

Wooden packaging must comply with ISPM-15 (heat treated and marked) to meet phytosanitary requirements.",
    "faq5AirLabel": "Air Freight:",

    "faq7A1": "Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) are standardized trade rules published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. The most commonly used Incoterms include:",
    "faq7EXWLabel": "EXW (Ex Works):",
